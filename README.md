# GRI-Sustainability-Reports-Analysis-Workflow

The proposed workflow allows to identify and locate references to the various sustainability topics covered by the reports, extract the contexts of each reference, and provide a summary that can highlight the most relevant discussed aspects.

This work may help stakeholders to analyze and use the reports in an efficient and faster way than usual, providing disclosure complaint summaries generated from pages related to each GRI code.
